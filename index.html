              I fixed an issue where a recipe would be duplicated for every
              entry in localstorage after the tab had been opened for some time.
              Make sure that still doesnt happen. Also, adding a pagination for
              the front page and removing the max number of recipes queried
              might be a good idea depending on what the styling looks like
              later on. Finally the bug where index was rendering before
              localhost was being populated seems to be fixed but may require
              more testing.

              >Since the config.html page was added the website doesn't run
              directly on config.json. For the first time it will use its values
              but after that there will be fields in local storage under
              "config" that can be changed by whoever uses it. config.json is
              more of a guide for the first time it runs instead of persistent
              values, which I'm okay with.
